Challenge 3: Lambda Expressions
Write a lambda function that takes two numbers and returns their product. 
Then, using this lambda, create a list of products by pairing elements from two different lists.

Task:
Define a lambda function that multiplies two numbers.
Use this lambda function in a map() function to pair and multiply elements from two lists.
Print the resulting list of products.

Example 1:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
The resulting list of products should be: [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c', 2, 4, 6].

Example 2:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
The resulting list of products should be: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180]

Let me know once you've attempted it or if you need any assistance!
